# Hi, I'm Ryan! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Science major at Northeastern University.

As you can see from my Github stats, I code a lot! Mostly for Code 4 Community, a student organization that develops software for nonprofits in Boston.

I also blog at my website: [ryanjung.dev](https://ryanjung.dev). Go there for more!
