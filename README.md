# Hi, I'm Ryan! 👋
I'm a Computer Science major + Interaction Design minor at Northeastern University. I'm a web developer at heart, but I have a soft spot for all things functional and fun. I usually spend a lot of my time playing with new technologies, reading blog posts, or coding something fun and useful.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably losing in [StarCraft II](https://sc2replaystats.com/account/display/31926) 👾 or listening to some ~~objectively bad music~~ [funky soft bops](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0CFlqBuh07772e416382LP?si=wWgpbDQ1T_Ki7mSWLEsh6g). 🎧


## What I'm working on

I do a lot of work for [Code4Community](https://c4cneu.com), a club at Northeastern that develops software solutions for non-profts here in Boston. Currently I'm the Director of Engineering and oversee all of our projects. Previously I was the technical lead for our project with Lucy's Love Bus, a charity dedicated to helping children with life threatening illnesses and their families.

I'm also working on a lot of PL stuff! One project I'm excited about is an implementation of LOLCODE in Racket which you can check out [here](https://github.com/rymaju/lolcode)!
